# **Advanced Prompt Protocol: Eve AI.Rio PRD Integration Update**

## **Context & Mission**

You are a **Technical Product Owner** with deep expertise in enterprise SaaS product development, microservices architecture, and LGPD compliance. Your mission is to systematically update the Eve AI.Rio PRD to align with the comprehensive chunking-system integration architecture.

**Critical Context Files to Load:**
1. **Current PRD:** `/root/dev/.devcontainer/ai-rio/docs/eve-ai-rio-prd.md` (v5.0)
2. **Integration Architecture:** `/root/dev/.devcontainer/ai-rio/docs/eve-ai-rio-chunking-integration-architecture.md` (v1.0)
3. **Original Architecture:** `/root/dev/.devcontainer/ai-rio/docs/eve-ai-rio-architecture.md` (v3.1)

## **Identified Critical Gaps Requiring Immediate Action**

### **ðŸš¨ Gap 1: Missing Epic 6 - Enterprise Integration & Resilience**
The PRD lacks enterprise-grade integration capabilities specified in the architecture:

**Required User Stories (5 new stories needed):**
- **Story 6.1:** Secure Service-to-Service Integration (Mutual TLS, API keys, circuit breakers)
- **Story 6.2:** Async Job Processing & Status Management (ProcessingJobs collection, real-time updates)
- **Story 6.3:** Advanced Error Handling & Resilience (Retry policies, graceful degradation)
- **Story 6.4:** Performance Optimization & Caching (Redis integration, connection pooling)
- **Story 6.5:** Enterprise Monitoring & Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, alerting)

### **ðŸš¨ Gap 2: Missing Data Models**
**Critical collections not documented in PRD:**
- `ProcessingJobs` collection (job tracking across distributed system)
- Enhanced `Documents` collection (chunking metadata, security flags)
- Enhanced `AnalysisReports` collection (processing metrics, quality scores)
- `AuditTrail` collection (enterprise compliance tracking)

### **ðŸš¨ Gap 3: Updated Non-Functional Requirements**
**Missing enterprise NFRs:**
- Inter-service communication performance (<2s response time)
- Distributed system reliability (99.9% uptime SLA)
- Cross-service data encryption requirements
- Chunking system integration monitoring requirements

### **ðŸš¨ Gap 4: Enhanced Technical Assumptions**
**Architecture introduces new technical dependencies:**
- Redis for caching and job queuing
- Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
- Docker/Kubernetes deployment requirements
- Advanced security patterns (mutual TLS, API keys)

## **Systematic Update Instructions**

### **Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement**
Update the Technical Assumptions section to include:

```yaml
**Enhanced Data Models for Integration:**
- **ProcessingJobs Collection:** Tracks document analysis jobs across distributed system
- **Enhanced Documents Collection:** Added chunking metadata, security validation, processing status
- **Enhanced AnalysisReports Collection:** Added quality metrics, processing time, chunking metadata
- **AuditTrail Collection:** Enterprise compliance and audit logging
- **Integration Monitoring:** Redis caching, job queue management, health checks
```

### **Phase 2: New Epic 6 Creation**
Add comprehensive Epic 6 with detailed acceptance criteria:

```yaml
## **Epic 6: Enterprise Integration & Resilience**

**Goal:** To implement enterprise-grade integration with the chunking system, ensuring secure communication, robust error handling, comprehensive monitoring, and production-ready performance optimization.

### **Story 6.1: Secure Service-to-Service Integration**
**As a system architect, I want secure communication between Eve AI.Rio and the chunking system, so that document processing is protected with enterprise-grade security.**

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. Mutual TLS authentication configured between Payload CMS and chunking system
2. API key management system for service-to-service authentication
3. Circuit breaker pattern implemented to handle chunking system failures
4. Rate limiting configured (100 requests/minute per service)
5. Request/response encryption with correlation IDs for tracing
6. Security audit logging for all inter-service communications

### **Story 6.2: Async Job Processing & Status Management**
**As a legal professional, I want real-time status updates on my document analysis, so that I know exactly when my report will be ready.**

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. ProcessingJobs collection created with job lifecycle tracking
2. Real-time WebSocket/polling for job status updates in frontend
3. Job queue management with Redis backend
4. Processing status dashboard showing current queue depth and estimated completion times
5. Automatic retry mechanism for failed jobs (max 3 retries with exponential backoff)
6. Job timeout handling (30-minute maximum processing time)

### **Story 6.3: Advanced Error Handling & Resilience**
**As a system administrator, I want the platform to gracefully handle chunking system failures, so that users have a consistent experience even when components are down.**

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. Standardized error response format across all integration points
2. Circuit breaker prevents cascade failures when chunking system is down
3. Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages in Portuguese
4. Automatic retry queue for transient failures
5. Error classification system (retryable vs permanent errors)
6. Comprehensive error monitoring and alerting integration

### **Story 6.4: Performance Optimization & Caching**
**As a system architect, I want optimized performance for document processing, so that we meet our <90 second SLA for analysis completion.**

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. Redis caching layer for frequently analyzed document patterns
2. Connection pooling for database and chunking system connections
3. Async processing prevents frontend blocking
4. Memory optimization for large document handling
5. Performance monitoring with 50th, 95th, 99th percentile tracking
6. Auto-scaling triggers based on queue depth and processing load

### **Story 6.5: Enterprise Monitoring & Observability**
**As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring of the integrated system, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.**

#### **Acceptance Criteria**
1. Prometheus metrics collection for all integration points
2. Grafana dashboards for real-time system monitoring
3. Health check endpoints for chunking system connectivity
4. Business metrics tracking (analysis success rate, processing times)
5. Alert management for critical system failures
6. Distributed tracing with correlation IDs across service boundaries
```

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Non-Functional Requirements**
Add new NFRs for distributed system operation:

```yaml
### **Enterprise Integration NFRs**

- **NFR7:** Inter-service communication must maintain <2 second response time for job submission
- **NFR8:** System must achieve 99.9% uptime SLA including chunking system integration
- **NFR9:** All cross-service data must be encrypted with mutual TLS authentication
- **NFR10:** Processing job queue must handle up to 1000 concurrent analysis requests
- **NFR11:** System must automatically recover from chunking system failures within 5 minutes
- **NFR12:** All integration points must emit structured logs with correlation IDs for debugging
```

### **Phase 4: Updated Change Log**
Update the PRD change log:

```yaml
| 2025-07-18 | 6.0 | Added Epic 6: Enterprise Integration & Resilience with 5 user stories for chunking system integration. Enhanced data models, NFRs, and technical assumptions to support enterprise-grade distributed system architecture. | Sarah, Product Owner |
```
