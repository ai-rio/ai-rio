# **Eve AI.Rio - LGPD Compliance Specialist PRD**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

# - To drastically reduce the time and manual effort required for legal professionals to conduct LGPD compliance reviews on contracts and other legal documents.

- To significantly mitigate the financial and reputational risks faced by large Brazilian corporations due to LGPD non-compliance.

- To deliver a "lovable" product experience that transforms the role of in-house legal teams from a business bottleneck into a strategic, high-speed enabler.

- To establish Eve AI.Rio as the definitive market leader in the specialized niche of AI-powered legal compliance within Brazil.

### **Background Context**

# The Brazilian legal market operates under immense pressure from high document volumes and a complex, constantly evolving regulatory landscape. The enactment of the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD) has created a critical pain point for corporations, with severe financial penalties for non-compliance. Our market research indicates that a vast majority of Brazilian companies are not fully compliant, facing significant challenges in adapting their processes and analyzing the risk embedded in thousands of contracts.Our target micro-segment—in-house legal departments at large corporations—feels this pain most acutely as they are the direct owners of this risk. Existing Legaltech solutions are often too generic, failing to provide the deep, context-aware analysis required for Brazilian law, while manual review is slow, expensive, and prone to human error. Eve AI.Rio addresses this specific, high-value gap by leveraging its proprietary document processing engine to offer an "LGPD Compliance Specialist" agent. This agent provides the automated, accurate, and trustworthy analysis needed to turn a high-stakes compliance burden into a manageable, data-driven process.

## **Requirements**

### **Functional**

#### **User Account & Authentication**

# - **FR1-FR5:** A secure user registration, login, and session management system will be provided. All user-related data will be associated with the authenticated user.

  - **Implementation Note:** This will be achieved by configuring the built-in Users collection in Payload CMS.

#### **Document Analysis Workflow**

# - **FR6:** The system must allow authenticated users to securely upload legal documents in common formats, including .pdf and .docx.

- **FR7:** Upon successful upload, the system must automatically process the document and generate an interactive "LGPD Red Flag Report".

- **FR8:** The report must display a clear, high-level LGPD compliance risk score (e.g., Baixo, Médio, Alto Risco).

- **FR9:** The report must identify, highlight, and list all specific clauses within the document that are relevant to personal data processing under LGPD.

- **FR10:** For each identified clause, the system must assign a specific risk category (e.g., "Finalidade do Tratamento," "Consentimento," "Direitos do Titular").

- **FR11:** For each identified risk, the system must provide a concise, plain-language explanation in Brazilian Portuguese detailing the potential compliance issue.

- **FR12:** The system must provide a direct reference to the relevant LGPD article(s) for each identified risk to ensure transparency and build trust.

- **FR13 (Refined):** Users must be able to export the "LGPD Red Flag Report" in two formats:

  - **FR13.1:** A clean, formatted PDF suitable for sharing with stakeholders.

  - **FR13.2:** A "copy to clipboard" function that provides a plain-text version of the report for easy pasting into emails or other documents.

### **Non Functional**

# - **NFR1:** All user data, especially uploaded documents and analysis reports, must be encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256) to ensure the highest level of security and confidentiality.

- **NFR2:** The entire user interface, all reports, and all AI-generated content must be exclusively in Brazilian Portuguese.

- **NFR3:** The end-to-end analysis time for a standard 50-page document (from upload completion to report display) must not exceed 90 seconds.

- **NFR4:** The system's risk analysis must achieve a high degree of accuracy, leveraging the proprietary "Hybrid Chunking" engine to minimize false positives and negatives.

- **NFR5:** The platform must maintain a secure, immutable audit trail for all document-related actions (upload, analysis, export) for accountability purposes.

- **NFR6:** The user interface must be highly intuitive and require no formal training.

#### **Success Metrics for NFRs**

# - **Accuracy (NFR4):** Success will be measured during pilot testing by comparing the agent's findings against a review by a human legal expert on a benchmark set of 20 contracts. The target is to achieve >90% agreement on critical risk identification.

- **Intuitiveness (NFR6):** Success will be measured by a user's ability to successfully upload a document and interpret the report without any external guidance. During user testing, a target of 95% of users will complete this task without assistance.

### **Enterprise Integration NFRs**

- **NFR7:** Inter-service communication must maintain <2 second response time for job submission
- **NFR8:** System must achieve 99.9% uptime SLA including chunking system integration
- **NFR9:** All cross-service data must be encrypted with mutual TLS authentication

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

# The user experience will be clean, professional, and highly intuitive, designed to instill confidence in legal professionals. The core principle is to present complex compliance analysis in a simple, scannable, and immediately actionable format. The user should feel empowered and in control, with the AI acting as a trustworthy co-pilot, not a black box.

### **Onboarding & First-Run Experience**

# The initial user experience is critical. The first time a user logs in, they will be greeted with a clean interface focused on a single call-to-action: "Analise seu primeiro documento". A sample document will be available for immediate analysis, allowing users to experience the "aha!" moment within 60 seconds of signing up, without needing to find a document of their own.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

# The primary user journey will be a simple, linear workflow:1) **Upload:** A secure, clear interface for uploading one or more documents.

2) **Analyze:** The system provides clear feedback on the analysis progress.

3) **Review:** The user is presented with an interactive report that serves as the main workspace for understanding and acting on compliance risks.

### **Core Screens and Views (MLP Scope)**

# - **Dashboard:** A simple view showing a list of previously analyzed documents, their overall risk score, and the date of analysis.

- **Document Upload:** A dedicated, secure page for file uploads, likely with drag-and-drop functionality.

- **LGPD Red Flag Report View:** This is the core screen. It will feature a three-panel layout: a document overview/summary panel, the full document text in a central panel, and an interactive list of flagged risks in a third panel.

- **Implementation Note:** The UI should be constructed using shadcn/ui components.

### **Accessibility**

# The application will adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards.

### **Branding**

# The visual design will reflect the **Eve AI.Rio** brand: modern, trustworthy, and intelligent.

### **Target Device and Platforms**

# The application will be a responsive web application following a **"Desktop-First, Mobile-Responsive for Key Workflows"** strategy.

## **Technical Assumptions**

**AI Services:**
- **LGPD Document Analysis:** Chunking-system microservice (proprietary)
- **Email Template Generation:** OpenAI API integration for marketing content
- **Email Service:** Resend API for transactional and campaign emails

- **ProcessingJobs Collection:** Tracks document analysis jobs across distributed system
- **Enhanced Documents Collection:** Added chunking metadata, security validation, processing status
- **Enhanced AnalysisReports Collection:** Added quality metrics, processing time, chunking metadata
- **AuditTrail Collection:** Enterprise compliance and audit logging
