# **AI.Rio Platform PRD - Document Processing Platform**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

- To establish AI.Rio as the definitive horizontal AI platform for intelligent document processing across multiple industry verticals in Brazil and globally.

- To leverage proprietary "Motor de Chunking Híbrido" technology to deliver specialized AI applications for legal, finance, healthcare, and government sectors.

- To transform complex document analysis from manual, time-intensive processes into intelligent, automated workflows that deliver strategic business value.

- To position AI.Rio as the platform of choice for enterprises requiring specialized document processing with Brazilian market expertise and global scalability.

### **Background Context**

The Brazilian market faces immense challenges in document processing across multiple regulated industries. From LGPD compliance in legal sectors to financial regulations, healthcare data protection, and government compliance requirements, organizations struggle with high document volumes, complex regulatory landscapes, and the risk of non-compliance penalties.

Our market research indicates that most enterprise solutions are either too generic (lacking industry-specific intelligence) or too narrow (single-use tools that don't scale). AI.Rio addresses this gap by providing a **horizontal AI platform** with **vertical application specialization** - starting with our flagship Eve AI.Rio for legal/LGPD compliance, and expanding to Finance AI.Rio, Healthcare AI.Rio, and Government AI.Rio applications.

The platform leverages our proprietary chunking technology to provide consistent, high-quality document processing while allowing each vertical application to deliver specialized analysis tailored to specific regulatory and business requirements.
